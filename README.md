## Compliments Package 

This package takes a mood as input and returns a compliment in response to your mood and gives you a suggestion for a house plant to check out.

Right now, this package can take three inputs: happy, sad, and angry.

This package is useful if you are having a bad day, or even if you are having a good day and just want some validation.
